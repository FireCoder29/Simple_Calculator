### ➕ add(a, b)
Returns the sum of two numbers.

### ➖ subtract(a, b)
Returns the difference of two numbers.

### ✖️ multiply(a, b)
Returns the product of two numbers.

### ➗ divide(a, b)
Returns the division result of two numbers.

If the second argument is 0, it raises:
ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
